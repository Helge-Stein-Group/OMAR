README.txt for the standalone version of earth
----------------------------------------------

This directory contains the files to build a standalone version of earth.

Please see the files make-microsoft.bat and make-gcc.bat, 
and the Makefile if you want to use that.

Have fun!  Let me know if you have problems.
