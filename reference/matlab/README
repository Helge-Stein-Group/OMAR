The files in this directory are for the Matlab interface to earth.

The interface is implemented as a Matlab object in the file earth.m.  Type 
"doc earth" for user documentation.

The class uses the binary mex interface earthmex, which must be built and
exist on the search path.  This file is called earthmex.mexmaci64 on a 64-bit 
Mac and a recent version of Matlab, but the extension will vary (at least)
by platform.

With luck, the mex binary can be built from earthmex.c as follows:
1.  In Matlab change to the directory containing this file
2.  Copy the following into the command window and press enter:
  mex -DSTANDALONE -DMATLAB -I../src earthmex.c ../src/earth.c ...
    ../src/blas/d_sign.c ../src/blas/daxpy.c ../src/blas/dcopy.c ...
    ../src/blas/ddot.c ../src/blas/dnrm2.c ../src/blas/dqrls.c ...
    ../src/blas/dqrsl.c ../src/blas/dscal.c ../src/blas/dtrsl.c ...
    ../src/R/dqrdc2.c

If everything is set up correctly and the binary is built as required, 
then earthtest.m demonstrates the functionality.  The file trees.txt is
used for one example, and is derived from files for the dataset "trees"
in the R environment.

For a Mac platform the xcode project matlab.xcodeproj (which uses the 
file mex.xconfig) should also build the mex binary.
